    "3.Flexible indexing: MongoDB offers flexible indexing options that allow for efficient query\n",
    "performance on a variety of data types, including geospatial data and text search. Indexes can be created on individual \n",
    "fields or combinations of fields, and can be either ascending or descending.\n",
